    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the internet home of Chapter Z – The Central Illinois Wing Riders.
      We would like to invite you and your family to join us for some fun and motorcycle riding.
      Our Chapter has a diverse schedule of activities that includes local and long trips to motorcycling activities, scenic trips,
      and “Bucket List” locations. We try to have at least one long trip lasting a week or more and several weekend trips every year.
      There are day trips to local festivals and other Chapters’ events, as well as weekly evening rides for dinner or ice-cream.
      We strive to keep our calendar full, allowing our members plenty of opportunity to pick and choose the events
      in which they would like to participate.
