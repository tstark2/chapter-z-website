    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the internet home of the Gold Wing Road Riders Association (GWRRA) Illinois Chapter Z.
      We would like to invite you and your family to join us for some fun and motorcycle riding.
      Our Chapter has a diverse schedule of activities that includes local and long trips to GWRRA activities,
      scenic trips, and “Bucket Trip” locations.
      We try to have at least one long trip lasting a week or more and several weekend trips every year.
      There are day trips to local festivals and other GWRRA chapter’s events, as well as weekly evening rides for
      dinner or ice-cream.
      We strive to keep our calendar full, allowing our members plenty of opportunity to pick and choose the events in
      which they would like to participate.

        <strong>Fun - </strong>
        As a family organization, GWRRA has certain fun groups to include restaurant, picnic and campout runs.
        We also have GWRRA groups to include charities, parades, and small or large events across the country.
        GWRRA Members can participate in live or video seminars through
        <a target="_blank" href="https://gwrra.org/regional/ridered/PDF%20Files/UpdatedRiderEdTrifoldBrochure2013_mod.pdf">Rider Education Programs</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Safety - </strong>
        We strive for improvement through GWRRA safety workshops.
        We will share technical expertise, news and tips about riding, maintenance, and the best touring routes in the world.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://gwrra.org/regional/ridered/index.html">Safety is for Life</a> on our GWRRA Rider Education Programs page.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Knowledge - </strong>
        While generalization about a group of individuals as large as today's GWRRA is difficult,
        GWRRA Members are likely to be independent thinkers, fun-loving, generous, adventurous, cooperative,
        and unfazed by the natural challenges of riding in the rain, temperature extremes or highway uncertainties.
        Many Members have completed CPR and first aid training, making them the best-prepared motorcycle riders on the
        world's highways! Find "CPR and First Aid Training" on our GWRRA
