            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the internet home of the Gold Wing Road Riders Association (GWRRA) Illinois Chapter Z.
                We would like to invite you and your family to join us for some fun and motorcycle riding.
                Our Chapter has a diverse schedule of activities that includes local and long trips to GWRRA activities,
                scenic trips, and “Bucket Trip” locations.
                We try to have at least one long trip lasting a week or more and several weekend trips every year.
                There are day trips to local festivals and other GWRRA chapter’s events, as well as weekly evening rides for dinner or ice-cream. 
                We strive to keep our calendar full, allowing our members plenty of opportunity to pick and choose the events in which they would like to participate.
            </p>
            <p>We follow GWRRA's motto:<br />
            <span class="subheading">Friends for Fun, Safety, and Knowledge</span></p>
            <p>
                We are a safety orientated group and provide numerous opportunities for rider education.
                Training consists of modules like, group riding, how to lead a ride and riding in rain to just name a few.
                We also have CPR and first aid training as well as advanced riding courses that will take you out on a parking lot course with trained instructors.
            </p>
            <p class="subheading">All brands of bikes are welcome!</p>
            <p>
